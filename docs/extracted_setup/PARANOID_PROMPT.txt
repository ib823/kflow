I am invoking EXTREME KIASU MODE. You are operating under ZERO TRUST assumptions.

CONTEXT:
- This is the KerjaFlow codebase - an ASEAN Enterprise Workforce Management Platform
- Read CLAUDE.md in the repo root FIRST - it contains all project rules
- You have been given access to potentially fuck things up - I assume you WILL try
- Every claim you make MUST be verified with actual file paths and line numbers
- Every file you say exists MUST be proven with `cat` or `ls`
- Every feature you say is implemented MUST be proven with actual code snippets

YOUR MISSION:
Execute a comprehensive production readiness audit with the following constraints:

1. ANTI-HALLUCINATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY):
   - You MUST run actual commands to verify EVERYTHING
   - You MUST NOT claim any file exists without `ls` or `cat` proof
   - You MUST NOT claim any feature works without showing the actual code
   - You MUST NOT assume ANYTHING - verify or mark as UNVERIFIED
   - If you cannot verify something, say "UNVERIFIED: [reason]"
   - Every finding MUST have an evidence reference: [EV-XXX]

2. EXHAUSTIVE ENUMERATION (NO SHORTCUTS):
   - List EVERY model file in backend/odoo/addons/kerjaflow/models/
   - List EVERY controller file in backend/odoo/addons/kerjaflow/controllers/
   - List EVERY screen file in mobile/lib/features/*/presentation/
   - List EVERY ARB translation file in mobile/lib/l10n/
   - Count the EXACT number of translation keys in EACH file
   - Verify EVERY file mentioned in docs matches actual implementation

3. SECURITY AUDIT (PARANOID MODE):
   - Find the EXACT line where JWT algorithm is defined - is it HS256 or RS256?
   - Find the EXACT line where PIN hashing is implemented - what algorithm?
   - Find ANY hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords in the codebase
   - Find ANY use of `http://` instead of `https://` in production code
   - Find ANY use of `float` for money calculations (should be Decimal)
   - Find ANY SQL queries that might be vulnerable to injection
   - Find ANY missing input validation in controllers

4. SPECIFICATION VS IMPLEMENTATION (CONTRADICTION HUNTING):
   - Read docs/specs/ and compare against actual implementation
   - Every screen mentioned in Mobile UX Spec - does it exist?
   - Every API endpoint in API Contract - is it implemented?
   - Every model in Data Foundation - does the file exist?
   - List ALL contradictions between spec and code

5. COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION (ASEAN STATUTORY):
   - Is there a statutory rate table for ALL 9 ASEAN countries?
   - Is the EPF calculation using payslip_date or current date?
   - Are SOCSO ceiling limits correctly implemented?
   - Is country_code included in ALL employee queries?

6. QUALITY GATES (PROVE THEY WORK):
   - Run `python3 -m black --check backend/` and show output
   - Run `python3 -m flake8 backend/` and show output  
   - Run `python3 -m bandit -r backend/ -ll` and show output
   - Run `flutter analyze` in mobile/ and show output (if Flutter available)
   - Show ACTUAL test count and coverage (not assumed)

7. MISSING FILE DETECTION:
   - Is `kf_user_device.py` in models/? (Known missing)
   - Are all 27 screens from UX spec implemented?
   - Are all 12 ARB files present with equal key counts?

8. OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
   For each finding, use this format:
   
   ### F-XXX: [Finding Title]
   
   | Attribute | Value |
   |-----------|-------|
   | Severity | BLOCKER / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
   | Category | Security / Compliance / Quality / Implementation |
   | Status | PROVEN / UNVERIFIED |
   | Evidence | [EV-XXX] |
   
   **Evidence:**
   ```
   [Actual command output or code snippet]
   ```
   
   **Fix Required:**
   [Specific fix with file path and line number]

9. FINAL DELIVERABLES:
   - Findings summary table (sorted by severity)
   - Work items with hour estimates
   - Blockers that MUST be fixed before production
   - Overall READY / NOT READY verdict with justification

10. ZERO TRUST RULES:
    - If you're unsure, say "UNCERTAIN - needs manual verification"
    - If a command fails, document the failure, don't assume success
    - If you can't access a file, mark it as INACCESSIBLE
    - Do NOT make optimistic assumptions
    - Do NOT skip anything because it "probably works"
    - Do NOT trust previous audit results - verify fresh

BEGIN AUDIT NOW.

Start by:
1. Running `pwd` to confirm you're in the repo root
2. Running `ls -la` to show repo structure
3. Running `cat CLAUDE.md | head -100` to confirm you've read project rules
4. Then proceed with systematic verification of EVERYTHING

I expect this audit to take significant time and produce a comprehensive report.
Do NOT rush. Do NOT skip. Do NOT assume.

EVERY. SINGLE. THING. MUST. BE. VERIFIED.
